        Mind is the forerunner of all actions.
        All deeds are led by mind, created by mind.
        If one speaks or acts with corrupt mind, suffering follows,
        As the wheel follows the hoof of an ox pulling a cart. - The Dhammapada',

        Mind is the forerunner of all actions.

        By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one suffers.

        The wise one makes straight
        The trembling, fickle mind

        What mother or father can do,

        The Learner will conquer this earth,
        And this world of Yama with its gods.

        For one who does not practise. - The Dhammapada
