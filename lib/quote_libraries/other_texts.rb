            Even as a mother protects with her life her child, her only child,
            So with a boundless heart
            Should one cherish all living beings;
            Radiating kindness over the entire world. - Morning and Evening Puja and Reflections

            Is not born again in this world. - Morning and Evening Puja and Reflections
