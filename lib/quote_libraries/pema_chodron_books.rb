            'The path is the goal. - Pema Chodron',

            'It isn\'t what happens to us that causes us to suffer; it\'s what we say to ourselves about 
            happens. - Pema Chodron',

            'You are the sky. Everything else: itâ€™s just the weather. - Pema Chodron',

            'Sticking with that uncertainty, getting the knack of relaxing in the midst of chaos, 
            learning not to panic: this is the spiritual path. - Pema Chodron',

            'Be kinder to yourself. And then let your kindness flood the world. - Pema Chodron',

            'The only reason we don\'t open our hearts and minds to other people is that they trigger 
            confusion in us that we don\'t feel brave enough or sane enough to deal with. To the degree 
            that we look clearly and compassionately at ourselves, we feel confident and fearless about 
            looking into someone else\'s eyes. - Pema Chodron'
